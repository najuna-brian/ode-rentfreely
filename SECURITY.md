**Key ID**: `5DD7CEA7D609F145`  
**Email**: `security@opendataensemble.org`

### How to Use GPG for Encrypted Email

To send an encrypted security report, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Install GPG

- **macOS**: `brew install gnupg` or download from [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/)
- **Linux**: Usually pre-installed, or install with `sudo apt install gnupg` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo yum install gnupg` (RHEL/CentOS)
- **Windows**: Download from [Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/)

#### Step 2: Import Our Public Key

1. Save the public key block above to a file (e.g., `ode-public-key.asc`)
2. Import it into your GPG keyring:
   ```bash
   gpg --import ode-public-key.asc
   ```
3. Verify the key was imported:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-keys security@opendataensemble.org
   ```

#### Step 3: Encrypt Your Message

**Option A: Encrypt a text file**
```bash
# Create your report file
echo "Your security report details here..." > report.txt

# Encrypt it
gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient security@opendataensemble.org report.txt
```

This creates `report.txt.asc` - copy the contents of this file into your email.

**Option B: Encrypt directly from command line**
```bash
echo "Your security report details here..." | gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient security@opendataensemble.org > encrypted_report.asc
```

**Option C: Using your email client**

Many email clients (Thunderbird with Enigmail, Mail.app with GPG Suite, etc.) can encrypt emails automatically once you have the recipient's public key imported.

#### Step 4: Send the Encrypted Message

1. Copy the entire encrypted message block (including `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----` and `-----END PGP MESSAGE-----`)
2. Paste it into the body of your email to `security@opendataensemble.org`
3. Send the email (the subject line can remain unencrypted)

#### Quick Example

```bash
# 1. Import the key
gpg --import ode-public-key.asc

# 2. Encrypt your message
echo "Security vulnerability details..." | gpg --encrypt --armor -r security@opendataensemble.org > message.asc

# 3. Copy the contents of message.asc and paste into your email
cat message.asc
```

#### Troubleshooting

- **"No public key" error**: Make sure you imported the key correctly with `gpg --import`
- **"Key not found" error**: Try using the email address: `gpg --encrypt --armor -r security@opendataensemble.org`
- **Need help?**: If you're having trouble with GPG, you can send an unencrypted email, but we strongly recommend using encryption for sensitive security reports.

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT Token Security

- **Strong Secrets**: Always use strong, randomly generated JWT secrets
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
- **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after 24 hours by default
- **Refresh Tokens**: Refresh tokens expire after 7 days
- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production to protect tokens in transit
- **Secure Storage**: Store tokens securely on clients (e.g., React Native Keychain)

#### Role-Based Access Control

- **Roles**: The system supports `admin`, `read-write`, and `read-only` roles
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users only the minimum permissions they need
- **Default Admin**: Change the default admin password immediately after deployment

#### Password Security

- **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- **No Default Passwords**: Never use default passwords in production

### Data Protection

#### Encryption in Transit

- **HTTPS/TLS**: All API communications must use HTTPS
- **TLS Configuration**: Use TLS 1.2 or higher
- **Certificate Management**: Use Let's Encrypt or similar for automatic certificate management
- **Reverse Proxy**: Use nginx or similar reverse proxy for TLS termination

#### Encryption at Rest

- **Database Encryption**: PostgreSQL encryption at rest depends on the underlying storage layer
- **File Storage**: Attachments are stored on the filesystem; consider encrypting the filesystem
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypt database backups before storing them

#### Data Privacy

- **Local-First**: The Formulus mobile app stores data locally and only syncs to user-configured servers
- **No Third-Party Data Collection**: Formulus does not collect or transmit data to third parties
- **User Control**: Users control their own sync endpoints and data

### File Upload Security

#### Attachment Handling

- **Path Traversal Protection**: Attachment IDs are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **File Size Limits**: Multipart form parsing is limited to 32MB by default
- **Immutable Attachments**: Once uploaded, attachments cannot be modified (new uploads create new files)
- **Authentication Required**: All attachment endpoints require authentication
- **File Type Validation**: Consider implementing file type validation (currently not enforced)

#### Recommendations

- **Malware Scanning**: Consider implementing malware scanning for uploaded files
- **File Type Restrictions**: Validate file types and MIME types on upload
- **Size Limits**: Configure appropriate size limits based on your use case
- **Storage Quotas**: Implement storage quotas per user or organization

### Configuration Security

#### Environment Variables

- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Environment Files**: `.env` files are excluded from git (see `.gitignore`)
- **Production Secrets**: Use secure secret management systems in production (e.g., Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets, AWS Secrets Manager)
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate secrets, especially JWT secrets

#### Required Secrets

The following secrets must be configured securely:

- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token signing (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- `DB_CONNECTION`: PostgreSQL connection string (includes password)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Initial admin password (change after first login)
- Android signing keys: Keystore files and passwords (stored securely, never committed)

#### Default Values

- **Never use defaults in production**: Default values are for development only
- **Change admin credentials**: Always change default admin username and password
- **Generate strong secrets**: Use cryptographically secure random generators

### Deployment Security

#### Docker Security

- **Image Sources**: Use official images from trusted sources (ghcr.io, Docker Hub official images)
- **Image Scanning**: Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
- **Non-Root Users**: Containers run as non-root users where possible
- **Minimal Images**: Use minimal base images (Alpine Linux) to reduce attack surface
- **Secrets Management**: Use Docker secrets or environment variables for sensitive data

#### Network Security

- **Firewall Configuration**: Configure firewalls to allow only necessary ports
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
  sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
  sudo ufw enable
  ```
- **Internal Networks**: Use Docker internal networks for service communication
- **Reverse Proxy**: Use nginx or similar reverse proxy for TLS termination and rate limiting
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Consider using Cloudflare Tunnel for secure, zero-trust access

#### Database Security

- **Connection Security**: Use SSL/TLS for database connections in production
- **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for database users
- **Access Control**: Limit database access to only necessary services
- **Backup Security**: Encrypt and securely store database backups
- **Regular Updates**: Keep PostgreSQL updated with security patches

#### CI/CD Security

- **Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive CI/CD data
- **Build Attestation**: Build provenance is generated for Docker images
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Signed Builds**: Android APKs are signed with release keys (stored securely)

### Mobile App Security (Formulus)

#### Android Security

- **APK Signing**: Release builds are signed with secure keystores
- **Keystore Protection**: Keystore files and passwords are stored securely and never committed
- **ProGuard/R8**: Code obfuscation and minification for release builds
- **Permissions**: Request only necessary permissions

#### iOS Security

- **Code Signing**: Apps are signed with Apple certificates
- **Keychain Storage**: Sensitive data (tokens) stored in iOS Keychain
- **App Transport Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections

#### Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: Data stored locally using secure storage mechanisms
- **Token Storage**: Authentication tokens stored in secure keychain/keystore
- **Offline-First**: App works offline; data syncs only to user-configured servers

### API Security

#### Input Validation

- **Schema Validation**: All API inputs are validated against OpenAPI schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries (handled by Go database drivers)
- **Path Traversal**: Attachment paths are validated and sanitized
- **Size Limits**: Request size limits are enforced

#### Rate Limiting

- **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting at the reverse proxy level (nginx)
- **Authentication Endpoints**: Consider stricter rate limiting for login endpoints
- **API Endpoints**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### CORS Configuration

- **Origin Validation**: Configure CORS appropriately for web clients
- **Credentials**: Handle credentials securely in CORS configuration

### Dependency Security

#### Regular Updates

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Automated Updates**: Use tools like Dependabot or Renovate for automated updates
- **Security Advisories**: Monitor security advisories for all dependencies

#### Known Vulnerabilities

- **Reporting**: Report dependency vulnerabilities through the same process as code vulnerabilities
- **Patching**: Critical dependency vulnerabilities are patched as quickly as possible

### Logging & Monitoring

#### Security Logging

- **Authentication Events**: Log authentication successes and failures
- **Authorization Failures**: Log authorization failures
- **Suspicious Activity**: Monitor for suspicious patterns
- **Error Handling**: Avoid logging sensitive information (passwords, tokens, etc.)

#### Log Security

- **Sensitive Data**: Never log passwords, tokens, or other sensitive data
- **Log Retention**: Implement appropriate log retention policies
- **Log Access**: Restrict access to logs containing sensitive information
